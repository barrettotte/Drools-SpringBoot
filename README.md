# Drools

A project to experiment with using Drools to process business rules.

My current company has been using JBPM and Drools extensively for years, but I just wanted to learn how to set things up from scratch and the process of designing everything.
However, in this project I decided not to use JBPM (due to the lack of support in VS Code lol...).
