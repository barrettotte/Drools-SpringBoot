# Drools-BotW

A project to experiment with using Drools to process business rules. 
In this case, the business rules are the recipe system from [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild).


My current company has been using Drools extensively for years, so I wanted to learn more about it with a fun little project.
I also haven't done any Java/SpringBoot stuff in a bit, so this served as a decent refresher.


## Goals
* Learn how to setup a Drools project from scratch with Spring Boot
* Demonstrate a basic use case for Drools
* Additional practice making Spring Boot APIs
* Fetch data from in memory database
* Basic frontend


## Features
* Actuator - monitoring (**http://127.0.0.1:8098/actuator**)
* Drools - rules engine
* Swagger - API documentation (**http://127.0.0.1:8098/swagger-ui.html**)
* H2 Database for testing (**http://127.0.0.1:8098/h2-console**)
