# Drools

A project to experiment with using Drools to process business rules.

My current company has been using Drools extensively for years, but I just wanted to learn how to set things up from scratch and the process of designing everything.
I also haven't done any Java/SpringBoot stuff in a bit, so this served as a decent refresher.


## Goals
* Learn how to setup a Drools project from scratch with Spring Boot
* Demonstrate a basic use case for Drools
* Additional practice making Spring Boot APIs


## Features
* Actuator - monitoring (**http://127.0.0.1:8098/actuator**)
* Drools - rules engine
* Swagger - API documentation (**http://127.0.0.1:8098/swagger-ui.html**)
