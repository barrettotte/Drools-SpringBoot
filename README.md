# Drools-SpringBoot

A simple vehicle premium API to experiment with using Drools to process business rules.


My current company has been using Drools extensively for years, so I wanted to learn more about it with a fun little project.
I also haven't done any Java/SpringBoot stuff in a bit, so this served as a decent refresher.
