# Drools

A project to experiment with using Drools to process business rules.

My current company has been using Drools extensively for years, but I just wanted to learn how to set things up from scratch and the process of designing everything.
I also haven't done any Java/SpringBoot stuff in a bit, so this served as a decent refresher.
